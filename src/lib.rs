//! Rust Macro which embeds files into your executable. A fork of `rust-embed`
//! with a focus on usage in web servers.
//!
//! Please check out the
//! [readme](https://github.com/SeriousBug/rust-embed-for-web/blob/master/readme.md)
//! in the repository to get started. There's an
//! [example](https://github.com/SeriousBug/rust-embed-for-web/blob/master/examples/actix.rs)
//! available too!
//!
//! If you are using this with Actix Web, there's an existing responder
//! [`actix-web-rust-embed-responder`](https://lib.rs/crates/actix-web-rust-embed-responder)
//! which will handle everything for you, from negotiating compressed responses
//! to cache revalidation.
