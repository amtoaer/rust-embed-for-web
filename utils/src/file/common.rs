/// The file is embedded into the program for release builds, and dynamically
/// read for debug builds. This trait allows common access for both types.
///
/// There are associated types for each file which you can get with
/// `EmbeddedFile::Data`/`EmbeddedFile::Meta` or
/// `DynamicFile::Data`/`DynamicFile::Meta`. The data of the file depends on
/// this associated types because embedded files use static types while dynamic
/// files have to use owned types.
///
/// You can access the data by calling the `as_ref` function through the `AsRef`
/// trait. For example:
/// ```
/// # use rust_embed_for_web_utils::EmbedableFile;
/// fn print_hash<T: EmbedableFile>(file: T) {
///     println!("The file hash is {}", file.hash().as_ref());
/// }
/// ```
